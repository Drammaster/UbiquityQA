Was able to log in to the website fine with the login details provided.

Home page is branded with Ubiquity, but it is not on the top left hand side of the page, where as all the other pages have the logo located there.
Text on home page says "Welcome to the Ubiquity Tester admin page." instead of "Welcome to the Ubiquity Tester Test admin page.".

Edit Profile button takes me to the edit profile page.

Edit profile pages allows me to put in a new email, mobile, date of birth and password, but not the username.
Uppon pressing submit the information doesn't get updated. Leaving and returning back to the edit profile page resets all the fields back to their original text.
